Mindfulness is not always an easy thing to do, particularly if you have never undergo this experience before or if you are going through intense pain or strong emotions. The techniques required to cultivate greater mindfulness are incredibly simple if you take the time to give your all. As time progresses, mindfulness becomes easier to develop and being in the present moment becomes as much of a habit as our normal state of distractedness. Namaste!",
